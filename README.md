This project aims to analyze and predict churn rate for a multi-national bank using Python, primarily leveraging Jupyter Notebook, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data visualization. The dataset used contains various features related to customer behavior and demographics. Initially, exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are employed to uncover insights into customer churn behavior, such as identifying key factors contributing to churn. Visualization techniques including seaborn and matplotlib are utilized to visually represent trends, correlations, and distributions within the dataset. Following the EDA phase, predictive modeling techniques are applied to build a churn prediction model, utilizing machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests. The project aims to provide actionable insights to the bank for reducing churn rate and retaining customers. The Jupyter Notebook serves as a comprehensive documentation of the entire project workflow, from data exploration and visualization to model building and evaluation, facilitating reproducibility and transparency in the analysis process.
